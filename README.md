# Reviebot: AI-Powered Automated Code Review Tool

## Project Overview

Our goal is to develop an AI-powered tool for automated code reviews, aimed at enhancing code quality, reducing manual effort, and seamlessly integrating with existing workflows.

### Objective

- Develop an AI-powered tool that performs automated code reviews.
- Improve code quality by identifying and suggesting fixes for potential issues.
- Reduce the time and effort spent on manual code review.
- Integrate seamlessly with existing development workflows and tools.

### Motivation

The primary motivation for developing this tool is to gain hands-on experience with the principles of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). This project will provide practical insights into building a real-time, relevant tool from start to finish.

### Planned Deliverables

- **Code Submission:** Developers submit their code through a web interface.
- **Code Analysis:** LangChain backend analyzes the submitted code to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and areas for improvement.
- **Code Completion:** Assists developers by suggesting and completing code snippets as they write.
- **Review Generation:** AI generates review comments and suggestions for enhancing code quality.

### Expected Duration

- Minimum Duration: 2 months

### Tech Stack (Learn During the Project)

- Python, OOPs, and Libraries
- Machine Learning/Deep Learning Principles
- Large Language Models
- LangChain
- React JS/Next JS + other Development tools (frontend + backend)
- Github (Version Control System)
